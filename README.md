Simple machine learning model to help idenify breast cancer trends from 9 measured predictors. Uses sklearn's K-nearest neighbors classifier to predict label of some test data based on some training data from the csv file. 
Analyzes for which K number of neighbors does the algorithm perform the best, plotting misclassification error rate.
